Step 1: Access the Project

Log into your Replit account
Open the website project from your dashboard
Wait for the project to load completely

Step 2: Locate the Team Page Files

In the file explorer (usually on the left side), look for directories like:

src/pages
public/pages
components
views


Find files that might contain team information, such as:

team.html
about.html
team.js
TeamPage.jsx
team.php



Step 3: Remove Existing Team Members

Open the team page file
Look for HTML/JSX/template code containing team member information
Delete all team member sections/cards/divs, but preserve the overall container structure
If there's a database connection or JSON data source for team members, clear those entries as well

Step 4: Add Dr. Jan Duffy's Profile
Add the following HTML/JSX for Dr. Jan Duffy (adjust format to match your site's existing structure):
html<div class="team-member">
  <div class="team-member-image">
    <img src="images/team/jan-duffy.jpg" alt="Dr. Jan Duffy" />
  </div>
  <div class="team-member-info">
